Description:
Do you often find yourself staring into your fridge, unsure of what to make with the ingredients you have? FreeRecipeMaker is the perfect solution for turning those random items into a delicious culinary creation. This web application allows you to add ingredients from your pantry or fridge, and with the power of OpenAI, it generates a unique recipe based on your selected items. Say goodbye to food waste and hello to creative cooking!

How It Works
FreeRecipeMaker utilizes the Matter.js library to create a visually engaging experience. The gravity effect simulates ingredients falling into a basket, adding a touch of fun to the process.
